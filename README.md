# 🚗 Car Number Plate Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements an automatic car number plate detection system using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It detects vehicle number plates from images or video feeds and extracts the license plate region for further processing.

## 📌 Features

- Detects car number plates in real-time (video) or static images.
- Uses deep learning models (like YOLO / CNN) for accurate detection.
- Image preprocessing and region of interest extraction.


## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (choose whichever you're using)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
